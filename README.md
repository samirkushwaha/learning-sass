# learning-sass
A website with various simple implementations of Sass.

Sass is a CSS pre-processor which simplifies CSS development. It's quick and easy to learn and hugely reduces code.

## Getting started with sass -

#### Install sass via npm by :
`npm install -g sass`

or Download the zip via the official website.
[https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.24.0](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.24.0)

Create folders for sass and styles(css) for easier conversion.

#### Enable sass with automatic conversion from sass to css by :
`sass --watch <sass-folder>:<css-folder>`

Replace **< sass-folder >** and **< css-folder >** with your respective folders.
